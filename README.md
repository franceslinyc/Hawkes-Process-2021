Description: 

Main report can be found [here](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Hawkes-Process-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_Masters_Project.pdf), presentation slides can be found [here](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Hawkes-Process-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_Presentation.pdf), and the algorithm  in particular the thinning algorithm and **spatstat** package of `R` used for simulating some of the processes in 1D or 2D can be found [here](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Hawkes-Process-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_Appendix.pdf).

Other reports are in the [analysis](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Hawkes-Process-2021/tree/main/analysis) folder:  

01_proc_HPP.Rmd simulates HPP

03_proc_Hawkes.Rmd simulates Hawkes process

04_proc_using_spatstat.Rmd simulates HPP, NPP, Cox and cluster processes in 2D using the **spatstat** package of `R`

Lin_Appendix.Rmd contains the algorithm in particular the thinning algorithm and **spatstat** package of `R` used for simulating some of the processes in 1D or 2D

Lin_Presentation.Rmd contains codes that produce slides for the [presentation](https://github.com/franceslinyc/Hawkes-Process-2021/blob/main/analysis/Lin_Presentation.pdf)
