## Acknowledgments

I want to thank 

- James Molyneux for his constant support and encouragement while advising this Master's project, 

- Lisa Madsen & Charlotte Wickham for their willingness to co-advise as I press on for the PhD program here at OSU, 

- Sarah Emerson for both academic and nonacademic support that played major roles in my decision to pursue the PhD here, 

- my cohort for summer comp (comprehensive exam) studies, theories HW and various other group projects, 

- our previous cohort and other PhD students for reassuring us that we will make it too despite the ongoing challenges, 

- my family and friends for keeping me sane while being remote, and my 92-year-old grandma for hanging in there while battling brain tumor since last year. 

- But no thanks, COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Oregon wildfires and the social unrest that sparked the Black Lives Matter & Stop Asian Hate movement.
